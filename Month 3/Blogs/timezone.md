## **1. Time Zones in JavaScript Date**

JavaScript `Date` objects **always store time internally in UTC** (Coordinated Universal Time). However:

* **Methods like `toString()` and `toLocaleString()`** show the **local time zone** (based on your computer settings).
* **Methods like `toUTCString()` and `toISOString()`** return the time in **UTC**.

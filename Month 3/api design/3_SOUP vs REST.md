Here is a structured and clean documentation comparing **SOAP** and **REST**, covering their definitions, usage, methods, request structure, and how REST addressed the limitations of SOAP.

## **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**

### 1. **What is SOAP?**

SOAP is a **protocol** for accessing web services. It relies on **XML** for messaging and operates over various transport protocols like HTTP, SMTP, or TCP. It uses **WSDL** for making API documentation.

### 2. **Use Cases**

* Enterprise-level applications where **security**, **transactional reliability**, and **strict contracts** are critical.
* Banking, airline booking systems, financial services.

### 3. **HTTP Methods Used**

SOAP primarily uses:

* **POST** (standard)
* May use other protocols (SMTP, etc.), but HTTP POST is most common.

### 4. **Request Structure**

A valid SOAP request includes:

* **HTTP Headers** (Content-Type: `text/xml`)
* A **SOAP Envelope**, which is an XML document containing:

  * `<Envelope>` (root)
  * `<Header>` (optional metadata)
  * `<Body>` (contains the operation and its parameters)

#### Example:

```xml
POST /Service.svc HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8

<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <GetUserDetails xmlns="http://example.com/">
      <UserId>123</UserId>
    </GetUserDetails>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

### 5. **Strengths**

* **Formal contract (WSDL)**
* **Built-in error handling**
* **Strong security** standards (WS-Security)
* **Reliable messaging**, transactions

### 6. **Limitations**

* Heavy and verbose (XML-based)
* Harder to implement and debug
* Tightly coupled to WSDL contracts
* Slower compared to REST due to XML parsing

## **REST (Representational State Transfer)**

### 1. **What is REST?**

REST is an **architectural style**, not a protocol. It uses standard **HTTP methods** and focuses on **resources** represented by URLs. It uses **WADL, Swagger** for API documentation.

### 2. **Use Cases**

* Modern web and mobile apps
* Lightweight, scalable, and faster systems
* Social media, e-commerce APIs, public APIs (GitHub, Twitter, etc.)

### 3. **HTTP Methods Used**

REST uses standard HTTP methods:

* **GET** – Retrieve data
* **POST** – Create a resource
* **PUT** – Update a resource
* **DELETE** – Remove a resource
* **PATCH** – Partially update a resource

### 4. **Request Structure**

A REST request typically includes:

* **HTTP URL** representing the resource (e.g., `/users/123`)
* **Headers** (Content-Type, Authorization)
* **Body** (for POST/PUT/PATCH), usually in JSON format

#### Example (JSON):

```http
POST /users HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Abir",
  "email": "abir@example.com"
}
```

### 5. **Strengths**

* Lightweight (JSON over XML)
* Stateless (each request is independent)
* Easy to consume and build
* More scalable and faster
* URL-based design improves readability

### 6. **Limitations**

* Less formal than SOAP (no strict contract)
* Needs manual handling for reliability, security, etc.
* Might not be ideal for complex transactional operations

## **REST Solves These SOAP Limitations**

| SOAP Issue                  | REST Solution                                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Verbose XML-only messaging  | Uses lightweight JSON or plain text                         |
| Complex WSDL-based contract | Human-readable URLs and JSON, often documented with Swagger |
| Slower due to XML parsing   | Faster due to compact JSON payloads                         |
| Complex security standards  | Simplified via HTTPS and OAuth                              |
| Poor web integration        | Natively uses HTTP methods and URLs                         |
| Stateful by default         | Stateless by default                                        |

## Summary

* **SOAP** is ideal for **secure and complex** operations requiring strict contracts.
* **REST** is best for **scalable, simple, and fast** web APIs.
* REST addressed SOAP’s verbosity, rigidity, and complexity with a more flexible and developer-friendly approach.

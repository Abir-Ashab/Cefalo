Here is a clean and structured documentation of **WSDL**, **WADL**, and **Swagger**, focusing on their purpose, creation, usage, and associations with SOAP/REST APIs.

---

## **WSDL (Web Services Description Language)**

### 1. **What is WSDL?**

WSDL is an XML-based language used to describe **SOAP-based** web services. It defines the operations offered by a service, the input and output messages, and how they are transported.

### 2. **When is WSDL Created?**

WSDL files are **automatically generated** when a SOAP web service is built and deployed using frameworks like:

* Java (JAX-WS)
* .NET (WCF/ASMX)
* Python (Spyne)

The WSDL is usually accessible at a URL like:

```
http://yourdomain.com/service?wsdl
```

### 3. **When is WSDL Used?**

* When a **client** (like Postman, SOAP UI, or another program) wants to interact with a SOAP API, it uses the WSDL to understand:

  * Available methods (operations)
  * Required parameters and data types
  * Endpoint URLs and binding protocols

### 4. **Associated With**

* **SOAP APIs only**

### 5. **Purpose**

* Describes the service contract
* Enables code generation for client stubs
* Acts as formal documentation of the SOAP API

## **WADL (Web Application Description Language)**

### 1. **What is WADL?**

WADL is an XML-based language designed to describe **RESTful** web services. It is similar to WSDL but for REST.

### 2. **When is WADL Created?**

WADL can be:

* **Automatically generated** by some Java REST frameworks like Jersey
* Or written manually (though this is rare)

A WADL file might be available at:

```
http://yourdomain.com/api/application.wadl
```

### 3. **When is WADL Used?**

* For describing available resources, HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), input/output formats
* Less commonly used today due to low adoption and better alternatives like Swagger/OpenAPI

### 4. **Associated With**

* **REST APIs**

### 5. **Purpose**

* Defines resources and endpoints
* Acts as a machine-readable documentation of REST APIs
* Can be used to generate client code (limited support)

---

## **Swagger (OpenAPI Specification)**

### 1. **What is Swagger?**

Swagger (now known as the **OpenAPI Specification**) is a widely used format for describing **REST APIs** in a **JSON** or **YAML** format.

### 2. **When is Swagger Created?**

Swagger docs can be:

* **Automatically generated** from code using tools like:

  * SpringDoc (Spring Boot)
  * Swashbuckle (.NET)
  * FastAPI (Python)
* Or written manually using Swagger Editor or API design tools

Files are often hosted at:

```
http://yourdomain.com/swagger.json
http://yourdomain.com/api-docs
```

### 3. **When is Swagger Used?**

* For interactive API documentation (e.g., Swagger UI)
* To test endpoints via a web interface
* For generating client SDKs
* For validating requests and responses

### 4. **Associated With**

* **REST APIs**

### 5. **Purpose**

* Human- and machine-readable documentation
* Provides interactive web-based testing (via Swagger UI)
* Enables tools to generate server/client code, test suites, and API mocks

| Feature                    | WSDL                    | WADL               | Swagger (OpenAPI)        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Used For**               | SOAP APIs               | REST APIs (rare)   | REST APIs                |
| **Format**                 | XML                     | XML                | JSON / YAML              |
| **Created By**             | SOAP frameworks         | Jersey or manually | REST frameworks or tools |
| **Auto-Generated**         | Yes                     | Sometimes          | Yes                      |
| **Usage**                  | Describe methods, types | Describe resources | Document and test REST   |
| **Tool Support**           | Strong (e.g., SOAP UI)  | Weak               | Very strong              |
| **Client Code Generation** | Yes                     | Limited            | Yes                      |

## Summary

* **WSDL** is for SOAP and defines operations, messages, and bindings.
* **WADL** is a REST counterpart to WSDL but is rarely used.
* **Swagger/OpenAPI** is the modern standard for documenting and testing REST APIs.

These tools are essential for **API consumers** and **developers**, allowing them to understand, integrate with, and test APIs efficiently.

`"main": "index.js"` specifies the **entry point** file of your Node.js package or project.

### What does "entry point" mean?

It tells Node.js (and tools like `require()` or `import`) **which file to load first** when your package is imported somewhere else.

---

### Example:

If you publish this package and someone does:

```js
const myPackage = require('test-environment');
```

Node.js will look inside your package's `package.json`, find `"main": "index.js"`, and then load `index.js` as the entry point.

---

### If you're not publishing the package:

Then `"main"` doesn't really affect anything unless you're using it in tools like:

* `node .` (which looks at `"main"` to decide what to run),
* bundlers like Webpack or Rollup,
* or making a reusable module.

If you're just running files directly like:

```bash
node index.js
```

then `"main"` is not used at all â€” Node just runs whatever file you specify.

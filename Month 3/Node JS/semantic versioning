**Semantic Versionin (Semver)** uses the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

1. **MAJOR**

   * Incremented for incompatible API changes.
   * Example: `1.0.0 → 2.0.0`

2. **MINOR**

   * Incremented for adding functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
   * Example: `1.1.0 → 1.2.0`

3. **PATCH**

   * Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes.
   * Example: `1.0.1 → 1.0.2`

**Understanding Patches, Features, and Major Changes**

* **Patch**
  A patch version (e.g., `1.0.1 → 1.0.2`) includes minor bug fixes that do not affect the software’s functionality or API.
  Example: Fixing a small UI bug without changing external behavior.

* **Feature (Minor)**
  A minor version (e.g., `1.1.0 → 1.2.0`) includes new features or improvements that are backwards-compatible.
  Example: Adding a new API method or performance improvements without breaking existing code.

* **Major Change**
  A major version (e.g., `1.0.0 → 2.0.0`) includes changes that break backwards compatibility.
  Example: Removing deprecated features or changing API structure that requires user code updates.

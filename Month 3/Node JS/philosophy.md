## Introduction to Node.js

**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside the browser. It is built on **Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine**, which compiles JavaScript into highly optimized machine code.

### Key Features

* **Cross-platform**: Supports development for desktop, mobile, and SaaS applications.
* **Event-driven, non-blocking I/O**: Ideal for real-time and data-intensive applications due to its efficient and lightweight architecture.
* **Versatile usage**: Commonly used in backend development, APIs, microservices, and tooling.

### Why Node.js is Written in C++

Node.js itself is primarily written in **C++**. The main reasons are:

* **Performance**: C++ offers high performance and low-level memory control, which is crucial for building a fast and efficient runtime.
* **Integration with V8**: The V8 engine, which Node.js uses to execute JavaScript, is written in C++. Node.js uses C++ to interact with and extend V8's capabilities.
* **System-level Access**: C++ allows Node.js to implement low-level features like file system access, networking, and asynchronous I/O operations — features not available in JavaScript alone.

## Browser vs Node.js

Although both environments use **JavaScript**, they are designed for different purposes and provide different sets of features:

### 1. **Environment Capabilities**

* **Browser**:

  * Focused on interacting with the **DOM** and **Web APIs** (e.g., `document`, `window`, `cookies`).
  * No access to low-level system APIs.
* **Node.js**:

  * Lacks browser-specific APIs like DOM manipulation.
  * Provides system-level modules such as `fs`, `http`, `os`, and more.

### 2. **API Availability**

* **Browser**:

  * Limited to sandboxed, security-restricted APIs.
  * Cannot read or write to the local file system.
* **Node.js**:

  * Full access to backend capabilities.
  * Enables creation of servers, file operations, and interaction with databases.

### 3. **Environment Control**

* **Browser**:

  * Developers cannot control the browser or its version that users use.
  * Must ensure backward compatibility, often using tools like **Babel** to transpile modern JavaScript to older versions (e.g., ES5).
* **Node.js**:

  * Developers can specify the Node.js version, ensuring predictable behavior.
  * Freely use modern JavaScript (ES2015+) features supported by the chosen Node.js version.

### 4. **Module System**

* **Browser**:

  * Primarily supports **ES Modules** (`import`/`export`).
* **Node.js**:

  * Supports both **CommonJS** (`require`) and **ES Modules** (`import`), offering flexibility in how code is organized and reused.

### Basic Metadata

```json
"name": "hello-prisma",
"version": "1.0.0",
"main": "index.js",
```

* **`name`**: The project is called `hello-prisma`.
* **`version`**: The current version is `1.0.0`.
* **`main`**: The entry point for the application (not actively used in this setup since it's TypeScript-based).

---

### Scripts

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only ./src/pagination.ts"
}
```

* **`start`**: When you run `npm start`, it uses `ts-node-dev` to run `./src/pagination.ts`:

  * `ts-node-dev`: A development server that restarts on code changes, optimized for TypeScript.
  * `--respawn`: Ensures the process is restarted on crash or file changes.
  * `--transpile-only`: Skips type checking for faster startup.

Great question — you're absolutely right that we *can* run a Node.js project directly using:

```bash
node index.js
```

So why do we often define and use scripts in `package.json`, like this?

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
}
```

Here’s **why scripts are useful and often preferred**, even though they're not strictly required:

---

**Convenience & Standardization**

You only need to run:

```bash
npm start
```

instead of remembering or typing a long command like:

```bash
node ./src/server.js --some-flag --another-flag
```

It standardizes how you and your team run the project.

---

**Tooling Compatibility**

Many tools like deployment platforms (e.g., Vercel, Heroku) and CI/CD pipelines look for `npm start` or `npm run build` by default. Having scripts ensures your project runs smoothly in those environments.

### Description, Author, License

```json
"keywords": [],
"author": "",
"license": "ISC",
"description": "",
```

* These are placeholders. They can be filled out for documentation or publishing to npm.

---

### Development Dependencies

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@types/node": "^22.15.21",
  "prisma": "^6.8.2",
  "ts-node-dev": "^2.0.0",
  "tsx": "^4.19.4",
  "typescript": "^5.8.3"
}
```

These are only used during development:

* **`@types/node`**: TypeScript definitions for Node.js.
* **`prisma`**: The Prisma ORM CLI tool (used for database schema and migration management).
* **`ts-node-dev`**: For running TypeScript files in development with live reload.
* **`tsx`**: Alternative runtime for TypeScript files, often used for better performance.
* **`typescript`**: The TypeScript compiler.

---

### Runtime Dependencies

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@prisma/client": "^6.8.2"
}
```

The `@` in `@prisma/client` indicates that this package is a **scoped package** on npm (Node Package Manager).A **scoped package** belongs to a **namespace or organization**. It helps group related packages together.

The format is:

```
@scope-name/package-name
```

In my case:

```
@prisma/client
```

* `@prisma` is the **scope** (belongs to Prisma organization)
* `client` is the **actual package name**

---

#### Why Use Scoped Packages?

1. **Organization**: Groups related packages under one name (e.g., Prisma, Angular, Babel).
2. **Avoid Name Conflicts**: You can have `@my-org/utils` and someone else can have `@their-org/utils` without conflict.
3. **Access Control**: Scoped packages can be private or public, useful in teams.
4. **Monorepos**: Large projects can publish many related packages under one scope.

---

## Examples of Scoped Packages

* `@nestjs/core`
* `@babel/core`
* `@apollo/client`
* `@sanity/client`

### Common licenses:
License doesn't stop copying — it defines what is legally allowed. The point is not to stop copying — the point is to protect your rights if copying leads to serious consequences.

| License     | What it allows                             | Example Use Case                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| MIT         | Do anything, just credit the author        | Most open-source projects          |
| ISC         | Same as MIT, even simpler                  | Personal/small projects            |
| GPL         | Open source only, must share modifications | Linux, strong open-source tools    |
| Apache 2.0  | Like MIT, but with patent protection       | Large companies prefer it          |
| Proprietary | Code is private, no reuse allowed          | Commercial products, closed-source |

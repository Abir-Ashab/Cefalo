You **cannot** use Prisma in your application with only `npm install prisma`. You **need both** `prisma` and `@prisma/client`, but for **different reasons**.

## Breakdown of the Two Packages

### 1. **`prisma`**

* This is a **development tool**.
* It includes:

  * The Prisma CLI (`npx prisma`)
  * Schema parser
  * Migration engine
  * Code generator (generates `@prisma/client`)
* You use this during development to **generate code**, migrate your DB, etc.

Install as a **dev dependency**:

```bash
npm install --save-dev prisma
```

---

### 2. **`@prisma/client`**

* This is the **runtime client**.
* It’s the actual package your app uses to talk to the database.
* It includes all the generated types and functions based on your schema:

  ```ts
  prisma.user.findMany()
  prisma.post.create()
  ```

Install as a **production dependency**:

```bash
npm install @prisma/client
```

---

## How They Work Together

1. You write your Prisma schema (in `schema.prisma`).
2. You run:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

   This command:

   * Uses the `prisma` CLI
   * Generates code inside `node_modules/@prisma/client`
3. Your app then imports and uses:

   ```ts
   import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
   ```

So, without `@prisma/client`, your app can’t run.
Without `prisma`, you can’t generate the client.

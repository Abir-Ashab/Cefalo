# **Journey of a POST Request: From Your PC to a Server in Norway**

Imagine Alex wants to visit `example.com` from their PC, which is connected via a **mobile hotspot** using a **Grameenphone SIM**. Alex clicks “submit” on a form, sending a **POST request**. What actually happens under the hood? Let’s explore every detail, from the browser to the server and back.

---

## **Step 1: Application Layer (Layer 7) – Preparing the Request**

* The browser acts as a **user agent** and creates the POST request.
* Example:

```
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

* At this stage, the request is just **data in memory**. The browser has no idea how it will physically travel.

---

## **Step 2: Presentation Layer (Layer 6) – Encryption & Formatting**

* Because the site uses HTTPS, the browser **encrypts the request using TLS**.
* Encryption ensures that anyone intercepting the request (even towers or routers) **cannot read the content**.
* Optional compression may also happen here.

---

## **Step 3: Session Layer (Layer 5) – Managing the Connection**

* A secure session is established between your browser and the server.
* Handles login states, cookies, and TLS handshake info.

---

## **Step 4: Transport Layer (Layer 4) – Segmenting Data**

* The encrypted request is split into **TCP segments**.
* TCP adds a **port number** (443 for HTTPS).
* Ensures **reliable, ordered delivery**, with error checking.

---

## **Step 5: Network Layer (Layer 3) – Adding IP Addresses**

* TCP segments are wrapped in **IP packets**.
* Source IP: your phone’s public IP (assigned by Grameenphone).
* Destination IP: the server in Norway.
* Routers use these IPs to forward the packets toward the destination.

---

## **Step 6: Data Link Layer (Layer 2) – Local Frames**

* Your PC converts IP packets into **frames** for the local network.
* Depending on the medium:

  * **Wi-Fi:** Frames contain your PC’s MAC and the hotspot’s MAC.
  * **Ethernet:** Frames contain your PC’s NIC info and the router’s NIC info.
  * **Mobile hotspot:** Frames go to your phone, which acts as a router.

---

## **Step 7: Physical Layer (Layer 1) – Signals in Motion**

Now the **bits become physical signals** to travel across the air or wires.

### **Mobile Data (Grameenphone SIM)**

* Inside your phone’s antenna, there are **electrons (negatively charged particles)**.
* Pushing electrons back and forth creates an **oscillating electric field**.
* This field naturally generates a **magnetic field**, and together they form an **electromagnetic wave** moving at the speed of light.
* The phone creates a **carrier wave** at a fixed frequency.
* To transmit data, it **modulates the wave**: changing amplitude (height) and phase (position) in precise patterns.
* Modern LTE/5G uses **QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)** to encode multiple bits per wave “symbol”.
* A **DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)** (inside our phone’s radio/modem chip) turns binary bits into an electrical signal, which the antenna converts into **radio waves**. 

### **Wi-Fi**

* Uses similar modulation, usually at 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz.
* PC or phone’s Wi-Fi chip converts bits into radio waves.
* Router antenna receives the wave, demodulates it into bits, and forwards it.

### **Ethernet**

* Bits are sent as **voltage changes** in twisted-pair copper cables.
* NICs convert bits to voltages and back.

---

## **Step 8: From Tower to Core Network (Mobile Data Specific)**

* The **nearest Grameenphone tower** receives the radio wave. It has ADCs (Analog-to-Digital Converters), not DACs. The ADC converts the incoming analog radio signal back into digital bits so the core network can route them.
* The tower **cannot read encrypted content**; it only forwards bits.
* Bits are sent via **fiber or microwave links** to Grameenphone’s **core network**.

### **Core Network Functions**

1. **Routing:** Determines the next hop toward the internet.
2. **IP Management:** Assigns and tracks public IP addresses, sometimes using NAT.
3. **Authentication & Security:** Ensures only valid devices can send/receive data.
4. **Forwarding to Internet Backbone:** Routes your packets to the global internet.

---

## **Step 9: Across the Internet Backbone**

* Packets travel through multiple **routers, switches, and undersea fiber cables**.
* Each router reads the **destination IP** and forwards the packet to the next hop.
* The process repeats until the packets reach the **server in Norway**.
* Throughout the journey, packets remain **encrypted**; only the destination server can decrypt them.

---

## **Step 10: Server Side Processing**

* Server receives TCP packets and **reassembles** them.
* TLS decrypts the content.
* Server reads your POST data and processes it.
* Server prepares an **HTTP response**, encrypts it, and sends it back.

---

## **Step 11: Response Returns**

* Response travels back through the **internet backbone → Grameenphone core network → tower → phone → PC**.
* Physical layer converts waves back into bits, then the browser decrypts and reassembles the response.

---

## **Step 12: Browser Renders the Web Page**

* Browser parses HTML, requests images, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Finally, the page is displayed on Alex’s screen.

---

## **Key Points**

* **Physical Layer**: Converts bits into **radio waves, electrical signals, or light pulses**.
* **Data Link & Network Layers**: Add addressing so packets can reach the correct destination.
* **Transport Layer**: Ensures **reliable, ordered delivery**.
* **Presentation Layer**: Encrypts/decrypts content.
* **Core Network**: Routes packets from your mobile tower to the **internet backbone**.
* **Internet Backbone**: Connects continents via routers, switches, and undersea cables.
* **Server**: Finally decrypts and processes your request.

> Without any one of these layers or systems, your POST request wouldn’t reach its destination or be secure.

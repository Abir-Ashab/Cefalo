You're absolutely right! In TypeScript (and JavaScript), **classes** can be used to group related functionalities, and they do provide a lot of benefits. So, why would we use **namespaces** instead of just **classes** to group related things? Let's break down the differences, and I'll explain the use cases for both.

### Key Differences Between Classes and Namespaces

1. **Classes**: 
   - A **class** is a blueprint for creating **objects** with specific behaviors (methods) and properties. Classes are primarily used for **object-oriented programming** (OOP), where you create instances of the class to work with.
   - Classes are **instantiable**: You can create an instance of a class and work with that instance (i.e., object-oriented instances).
   - **Encapsulation**: Classes allow you to define **private**, **protected**, and **public** members, giving you more control over your data and functionality.

2. **Namespaces**:
   - A **namespace** is a way to group **related functionality** under a single name to avoid **name conflicts**. It’s more about organizing your code rather than providing **object-oriented features**.
   - Namespaces are **not instantiable**: You cannot create an instance of a namespace. Instead, it’s just a container for related functions, variables, interfaces, or classes.
   - Namespaces provide a way to organize code **globally**. You typically use them when you don’t need the complexity of OOP and just want to logically organize related code.

### Why Use Namespaces Over Classes?

1. **No Need for Instantiation**: 
   - If you just want to group related **functions** or **data** without needing to create instances, a namespace is a simpler choice.
   - **Example**: If you're organizing utility functions, constants, or configurations, you don’t need to create an object each time to use them. A namespace suffices for grouping.

   ```ts
   namespace MathUtils {
     export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
       return a + b;
     }
     export function multiply(a: number, b: number): number {
       return a * b;
     }
   }
   
   // No need for an instance:
   console.log(MathUtils.add(2, 3)); // 5
   ```

2. **Avoiding Overhead**:
   - Classes can introduce unnecessary overhead, especially when you don't need to store state or manage instances. Namespaces are lightweight and directly accessible.
   - **Example**: If you want to group some utility functions and there’s no need to instantiate anything, using a namespace is cleaner and simpler.

3. **Organizing Global Code**:
   - Namespaces are often used in **global scope** (before ES6 modules became popular). If you’re dealing with legacy code or if your project is still using namespaces for organization, they provide a way to avoid naming conflicts in the global namespace.
   - **Example**: If you have multiple modules in your project and want to avoid function or variable name conflicts, namespaces can help avoid that.

4. **Grouping Without the Object-Oriented Overhead**:
   - If you don’t need the object-oriented features (like inheritance, polymorphism, etc.), namespaces are a lightweight way to group related code without the complexity of classes.
   - **Example**: If you're just grouping utility functions or constants (without needing the encapsulation or inheritance features of a class), namespaces work better.

### When to Use a Class Instead of a Namespace?

1. **Object-Oriented Design**:
   - If you need **stateful behavior** (properties and methods tied to instances) and you need to **instantiate objects**, then you should go with a **class**.
   - **Example**: If you're creating objects with unique states and need encapsulation, classes are the way to go.

   ```ts
   class Car {
     private speed: number;
     constructor() {
       this.speed = 0;
     }

     accelerate() {
       this.speed += 10;
       console.log(`Speed: ${this.speed}`);
     }
   }

   const myCar = new Car();
   myCar.accelerate(); // Speed: 10
   ```

2. **Encapsulation**:
   - If you want to **control access to data** (e.g., via **private**, **protected**, and **public** modifiers), classes provide better encapsulation than namespaces.
   - **Example**: A class allows you to hide the internal state and expose only necessary methods to interact with that state.

3. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**:
   - If you need to create subclasses or need **inheritance**, classes are the appropriate choice. Namespaces don’t support inheritance or polymorphism.
   - **Example**: If you want a base class that is extended by other classes, you’ll need a class.

   ```ts
   class Vehicle {
     protected speed: number = 0;
     accelerate() {
       this.speed += 10;
     }
   }

   class Car extends Vehicle {
     honk() {
       console.log("Honk!");
     }
   }

   const myCar = new Car();
   myCar.accelerate();
   console.log(myCar.speed); // 10
   myCar.honk(); // Honk!
   ```

### Example Where Namespace is Better Than Class

Let’s say you are building a library of **mathematical utilities** and you just want to group related functions. You don’t need to create instances of these utilities, and there’s no state to manage. A **namespace** is better than a class.

```ts
namespace MathUtilities {
  export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }

  export function subtract(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a - b;
  }
}

console.log(MathUtilities.add(5, 3)); // 8
console.log(MathUtilities.subtract(5, 3)); // 2
```

- No need to instantiate anything, and you’re just grouping related functionality. A **namespace** fits perfectly here.

### Example Where Class is Better Than Namespace

Now, if you're working with a **Car** object and need to track the car's speed, then a **class** is better because each car object will have its own state (speed).

```ts
class Car {
  private speed: number = 0;

  accelerate() {
    this.speed += 10;
    console.log(`Speed: ${this.speed}`);
  }
}

const myCar = new Car();
myCar.accelerate(); // Speed: 10
```

In this case, each `Car` instance has its own `speed` property, and we don't just group static functions; we model real-world objects with **stateful behavior**. A **class** is the appropriate choice.

---

### Recap

- **Namespaces** are great for grouping related functions, variables, or constants when you don’t need to instantiate anything. They are **lightweight**, **easy to use**, and ideal for **global organization**.
- **Classes** are used when you need **stateful objects** that can be **instantiated**, with features like **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.
- Use **namespaces** for simple groupings and organizing code in a non-object-oriented way. Use **classes** when you're working with **objects** that have state and behavior tied to them.
